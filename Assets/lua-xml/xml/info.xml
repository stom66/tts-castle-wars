            Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 
            40,000 kilometers. This should be interesting. I will obey your orders. I will serve this 
            ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. 
            
            But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, 
            wholeheartedly! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.
