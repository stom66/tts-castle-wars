## Quick Start

Castle Wars is a *two-person game*, no more, no less. Players must occupy the Blue and Red seats. 

#### Objective: 

A player is considered the Winner when either of the following conditions are met:

* Raise your Castle to level 100
* Reduce your Opponent's Castle to level 0

#### Structure:

The game consists of alternating rounds until a Win condition is met. During a Player's turn they may either **Play** a card, or **Discard** up to three (3) Cards.

#### Workers & Resources:

Each player has a number of Workers who each contribute a single unit of their respective resource at the start of a Player's turn. Player's Workers and resources are shown in their respective Player Panels:

* Blue's panel is on the left 
* Red's panel is on the right

##### Workers:

Each player starts with 2 of each of the following Workers:

* Builders
* Mages
* Soldiers

Additional Workers can be gained during the game via the *Builder*, *Mage*, and *Recruit* cards. It is also possible to steal a worker from your Opponent through the *Bribe* or *Curse* cards.

There is no upper limit to the number of Workers a player may have, although you cannot be reduced to less than 1 of each type of Worker.

##### Resources:

Additional resource are granted to a Player at the start of their turn. They receive resources equal to the number of each type of Worker they have.

Each card that can be played requires a certain amount of resource, shown in the upper-right of each card. If you cannot afford a card you may Discard it during your turn or play an altenate card. If no alternatives are available and the Discard action is undesireable a play may skip their turn with the "End Turn" button.

#### Beginning a Game:

To begin, each player must spawn a Deck of cards by using the "New Deck" menu on the Deck pad. Players may customise their Decks by removing or cloning cards. Place the Deck atop the Deck Zone and click the "Lock" button.

Upon locking a Deck it will be checked to ensure it does not contain more than the maximum amount of 280 cards, and does not contain more than five (5) copies of each individual card type. Invalid Decks will be rejected and the Player will be prompted to fix their Deck.

When both Players have locked in valid Decks the game will begin, starting with the Blue player. Play continues until a Win condition is met.
