# Credits

All credit for the original game goes to **m0rkeulv [[website]](http://m0rkeulv.net/)**, along with our thanks for the hours of fun spent playing his original Flash version of this game.

Due to the recent culling of Flash we decided to recreate the game inside of Tabletop Simulator. A large amount of work went into creating this mod and the following people made various contributions. 

* **LunarPenguin** ~ artist
* **Searanger** [[steam]](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Searangerx) ~ modelling, animations, particles
* **stom** [[steam]](https://steamcommunity.com/id/st0m) [[website]](https://stom66.co.uk/) ~ modelling, scripting
