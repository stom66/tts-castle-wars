# The UI

![The player score panel](/assets/img/info/info-ui.png)

Each Player has a panel of information about their Kingdom. Your panel will have your Steam name at the top and will match the color of your seat at the table.

#### Workers & Resources:

**1) Builders**
This is the number of Builders currently employed by your Kingdom. You receive an equal number of Bricks per turn.

**2) Bricks**
This is the number of Bricks your currently have. Mainly used for Green cards.

**3) Soldiers**
This is the number of Soldiers training troops for your Kingdom. You will receive this many Swords per turn.

**4) Swords**
This is the number of Swords you have available. These are mainly used for Red cards.

**5) Wizards**
This is the number of Wizards you have producing magical Crystals. Each Wizard produces a single Crystal per turn.

**6) Crystals**
This is your total balance of magical Crystals. These are typically used by Blue and Gold cards.

#### Castle & Wall Levels:

**7) Wall Level**
This is the level of your defensive Wall. Walls are cheaper to level up than the Castle and provide a valuable line of defence for your Kingdom. Be warned, some attacks can bypass your wall!

**8) Castle Level**
This is your current Castle level. If you can rise to level 100 before your opponent you'll win the Game. If this reaches 0 then your Kingdom has been defeated, game over, you lose!

#### Buffs:

**9) Magic Bricks**
When this buff is active any construction card will be twice as effective and raise double the normal levels. Try to use it with Babylon, Pixies, or another big building card.

**10) Resource Protection**
This buff prevents your Kingdoms resources being stolen by any of the Remove Resource cards.

**11) Magic Swords**
This buff doubles the strength of the next attack you make. When used with a high-damage card such as Trojan Horse or Comet the it's possible to do huge amounts of damage in a single attack.

**12) Magic Shield**
A magical "glass" shield - it will break after a single hit but will prevent any damage from being taken, no matter the strength of the attack.
