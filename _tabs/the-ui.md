This is your Castle. When it reaches level 100 you win the game! Defend it at all costs, if it reaches level 0 you lose!

### 2) Wall
A defensive wall that can absorb incoming attacks to protect your Castle. But be warned, some attacks can bypass the wall completely!

### 3) Mage's Tower
This is where your Mages live. The crystals they produce are also stored here. This building cannot be attacked.

### 4) Builder's Lodge
Home to your builders, the Lodge also creates and stores the raw materials (bricks) required to build your Castle and Wall. This building cannot be attacked.

Place your cards here to perform their action. You may only play one card per turn. Cards you cannot afford to play due to insufficient resources will be returned to your Hand Zone.

### 7) Hand Zone
This is where your current hand of cards will appear. You can play cands by moving them to the Play Zone. You can also right-click cards and Play or Discard them through the context-menu. You can also use the numpad keys `1` and `0` as shortcuts to Play and Discard cards respectively.
